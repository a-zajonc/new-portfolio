          I am self-taught front end developer. I started with learning CSS,
          HTML, JS. Then I moved on to React and recently I started learning
          TypeScript.

          Every project is an exciting journey and I cannot wait to start a
          professional one, where I can learn from others, improve and be a part
          of a team.
